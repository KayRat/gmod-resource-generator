gmod-resource-generator
=======================

A crude utility to automatically generate a Lua script that instructs the server to send players any and all unique content (materials, models, sounds) found on the server. The application is a CLI application that enables server owners to easily create an organized resource file with one console command (ideally to be ran with a server startup script).
